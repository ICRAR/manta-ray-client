# MWA ASVO Example CSV file
#
# This file can be used as a template for the manta-ray-client python
# command-line utility mwa_client. There are four common examples in this file.
#
# The simplest way to use this example is to install manta-ray-client, then:
#
# mwa_client -c example.csv -d /path/to/downloadfiles/to
#
# This will:
# 1. Submit all of the data jobs to the server
# 2. If you leave the client running it will block/poll until the data job files are ready for download
# 3. As each data job completes, it will download the files to the directory you specified in -d
#
# Alternatively, you can Ctrl-C the mwa_client after it submits the jobs and monitor and download
# the data yourself via the web interface.
#
# For full details and all possible settings (especially for data conversion
# jobs), visit:
#
# https://github.com/ICRAR/manta-ray-client and view the README.md

#
# Example 1: Conversion Job (uvfits output)
#            This will produce a uvfits file which:
#            * has been averaged to 80kHz fine channels (freqres)
#            * has been averaged to 10 seconds (timeres)
#            * has the first and last 80kHz edges flagged (edgewidth)
#            * will continue even if one or more of the gpubox files (i.e. the coarse channels) are missing (allowmissing)
#            * will flag the centre fine channel of each coarse channel (flagdcchannels)
#
obs_id=1104585920, job_type=c, timeres=10, freqres=80, edgewidth=80, conversion=uvfits, allowmissing=true, flagdcchannels=true

#
# Example 2: Conversion Job (CASA measurement set output)
#            Same as Example 1 but we will get a CASA measurement set as output, and we will ask for it to be calibrated
obs_id=1104585920, job_type=c, timeres=10, freqres=80, edgewidth=80, conversion=ms, calibrate=true, allowmissing=true, flagdcchannels=true

#
# Example 3: Download Job (metadata files)
#            Note: this will download RFI flag files and metafits for use in the
#            MWA preprocessing pipelines (cotter or RTS).You probably only want
#            to use this if you are an advanced user and are working within one
#            of the MWA Collaboration science teams.
#
obs_id=1104585920, job_type=d, download_type=vis_meta

#
# Example 4: Download Job (raw visibility files)
#            Note: the raw visibility files are in an MWA specific format. You
#            probably only want to use this if you are an advanced user and
#            are working within one of the MWA Collaboration science teams.
